1) please check the sample_usage file for samples
2) Dependency
	python:gdal,osgeo,numpy,cv2
	need to install osgeow in your system
3) The vectors in traning_vector_positive will be rasterised and their image coordinates will be saved in the positive_coordinates.txt file
4) The vectors in traning_vector_negative will be rasterised and their image coordinates will be saved in the negative_coordinates.txt file
5) path,rasterize_value(the value of the vector in the grayscale rasterised image), offset, type: required for vector
6) the path should point to the parent directory, you can have multiple vector of the same feature in the same folder, all be rasterised with the same value
7) Currently 3 types of vectors are supported
	line,point,polygon
8) the offset_in_pixels info is used according to the vector type
	a) for line: we save 4 points along with a given point in the line which are at distance=offset in north,south,east and west direction
		so if the point is x,y we also include
			x+offset,y
			x-offset,y
			x,y+offset
			x,y-offset
	b) for point: the neighbourhood of the point contains the necessary features which we want the model to learn
		the size of the neighbourhood is defined by the offset
		so starting from x-offset,y-offset to x+offset,y+offset are included keeping the step= window_size
